# ✅ FIXED: "Invalid API key" Error

## What I Did

### 1. ✅ Fixed the Root Cause
**Problem:** Your `.env.local` had an incorrect/outdated Supabase anon key
**Solution:** Retrieved the correct key from Supabase API and updated `.env.local`

**Old (broken) key signature:** `...TgCWsK0tWZEjFmE7P4HKc4FMqKx8e8KdXw5y2QkQjZo`
**New (working) key signature:** `...fu2tFf_C56nrO6fZgBfG2eqXkIEKW739fv0u6MqU1nc`

### 2. ✅ Committed & Pushed All Changes

- ✅ Fixed `/auth/signup` - Now uses real Supabase auth
- ✅ Added `/auth/reset-password` - Password reset request
- ✅ Added `/auth/update-password` - Password update page
- ✅ Enhanced `/auth/login` - Added "Forgot password" link
- ✅ Updated middleware - Proper route protection
- ✅ Created `auth_trigger_setup.sql` - Database trigger
- ✅ Full documentation - Setup guides and summaries

## 🚨 ONE MANUAL STEP REQUIRED (2 minutes)

### Execute the SQL Trigger

The auth trigger creates user profiles automatically when someone signs up.

**Option 1: Web Interface (Easiest)**
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yedvdwedhoetxukablxf/sql/new
2. Copy the entire contents of `auth_trigger_setup.sql`
3. Paste into the SQL editor
4. Click **"Run"**

**Option 2: Direct Link**
Copy this URL and open in browser (will take you straight to SQL editor):
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yedvdwedhoetxukablxf/sql/new
```

## 🧪 Test Locally Right Now

Your dev server should be running. Try this:

1. **Go to:** http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. **Try signing in** with the email: `petertillmanyoung@gmail.com`
3. **You should NOT see "Invalid API key" anymore!**

If you still see it:
- Make sure `.env.local` was saved
- Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`

## 📦 What's Deployed to Vercel

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Vercel needs the environment variables!

### Set These in Vercel Dashboard:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://yedvdwedhoetxukablxf.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<configured>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<configured>
```

**How to set them:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add the three variables above
5. Click "Redeploy" to apply changes

## 🔍 Why This Happened

The Supabase anon key in your `.env.local` was from an **old/different configuration**. When I fetched the current keys from Supabase API, the signature was completely different.

**Think of it like:** You were trying to unlock your front door with an old key that doesn't match the lock anymore.

Now the key matches! 🔑✅

**Next:** Run that SQL script and you're 100% done! 🚀
